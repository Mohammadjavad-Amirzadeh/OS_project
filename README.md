### Execution Instructions:

1. Initially, you need to place the shopping list of each user in the "users_shopping_list" directory. (Each user should have a file named "user{i}.txt," and the format for writing the file can be found in the same directory.)

2. Then, you can run the "store.c" file.

3. After a few seconds, when the file processing is complete, you should place the rating for each user in the "rates" directory. The format and file naming for this can also be found in that directory, where you need to save the rating in a text file.

4. Finally, when the rating files have been reviewed, the program will terminate.
